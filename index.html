        <div id="how-to-play">
            <p>Roll both dice and place their values into the 5x5 grid. Your objective is to create poker-style combinations (3-of-a-kind, 2-pair, etc) in each row and column.</p>
            <p>Press "Roll dice" to begin a turn and click on the dice you want to place - it will turn green to let you know it's selected. Then click where you would like to put it in the grid - your dice will turn red to let you know it's been used. Once you have used both dice, press "Roll dice" for the next round.</p> 
            <p>On a single turn, you cannot place both dice values on the same row or column - both numbers must be placed in entirely separate rows and columns from each other. Spaces in the play-area will turn grey to let you know they're unavailable.</p>
            <p>You do not have to place a dice value, if you do not want to.</p>
            <p>After 13 rounds, each row and each column will score points, based upon the combinations of numbers it contains. For example, a sequence like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in any order, will score as a 5-straight. The point values are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 straight = 7pt</li>
                <li>4 straight = 5pt</li>
                <li>3 straight = 3pt</li>
                <li>5 of a kind = 6pt</li>
                <li>4 of a kind = 4pt</li>
                <li>3 of a kind = 3pt</li>
                <li>Pair (+) = 1pt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notice the “+” next to “Pair”. This means that pairs can be scored along with other sequences - ie, another pair, three of a kind, or 3-straight. The pair must be made of values not used in another combination on that row or column.</p>
