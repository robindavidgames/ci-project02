# README for Full House Dice JavaScript Project

## Introductions
Full House Dice is a JavaScript implementation of an original game that I have designed. It is a casual game for a general audience.

## Features

## Testing

## Bugs and Issues

### Fixed Bugs and Issues
* In the calculateArray JavaScript function, values in an array are compared to see if they meet different poker hand requirements. However, if spaces on the board were left empty, this function was allowing the "null" spaces to act as Pair, Five of a Kind, etc. To fix this, I created placeholder arrays for each row and column, with unique entries in each space, therefore removing "null" entries.
